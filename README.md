# About

Fusio is an open source API management platform which helps to build and manage REST APIs. It can help you with the
following use cases:

* __API-Product__  
  Fusio helps you to create a great API product, besides building an API it provides a
  developer portal where developers can register and a way to monetize your API
* __API-Gateway__  
  Fusio can be used as gateway to your internal API and microservices. It handles all
  common features like Authorization, Rate-Limiting and Schema-Validation
* __SPA-Backend__  
  Fusio can be used as backend to build SPAs using popular Javascript-Frameworks like i.e.
  Angular, React or Vue. It provides a powerful code generator which can automatically
  generate a SDK for your API
* __Low-Code-Platform__  
  Fusio allows you to build API endpoints without coding knowledge. I.e. it provides an
  Entity generator which you can use to easily create complete CRUD APIs.
* __API-Framework__  
  For more complex use cases you can use Fusio also as framework to build complete APIs
  from scratch. This means you build custom actions where you can use the wide PHP
  ecosystem to solve your task

## API management and features

Fusio is an API management platform where you can configure routes which execute specific actions. An action triggers
your business logic, it is like a controller in a classical framework, you can also think of it like a serverless lambda
function, which can be executed on a route call or via RPC. Fusio covers many aspects of the API management life cycle
so that you can concentrate on writing the actual business logic of your API. Please take a look at our
[documentation website](https://docs.fusio-project.org/) for more information. The following feature list gives you a
first overview:

* __OpenAPI generation__  
  Fusio generates automatically an OpenAPI specification for the defined routes
* __SDK generation__  
  Fusio can automatically generate a client SDK for your API based on the defined schema
* __Subscription support__  
  Fusio contains a event subscription layer which helps to build pub/sub for your API
* __Rate limiting__  
  Fusio provides a way to rate limit requests based on the user or app
* __Authorization__  
  Fusio uses OAuth2 for API authorization
* __RPC support__  
  Fusio provides RPC support, every action which you create can be also called via JsonRPC
* __Monetization__  
  Fusio provides a simple payment system to charge for specific routes
* __Validation__  
  Fusio uses the TypeSchema to automatically validate incoming request data
* __Analytics__  
  Fusio monitors all API activities and shows them on a dashboard
* __User management__  
  Fusio provides a developer app where new users can login or register a new account through GitHub, Google, Facebook or
  through normal email registration

# Apps

Since it is difficult to work with an API only app Fusio provides apps which help to work with the API. Mostly apps are
simple JS apps, which work with the internal API of Fusio. You can see a list of all available apps at our
[marketplace](https://www.fusio-project.org/marketplace). You can install such an app either through a CLI command i.e.
`php bin/fusio marketplace:install fusio` or through the backend app.

All apps are installed to the `apps/` folder. You need to tell Fusio the public url to the apps folder at the `.env`
file by defining the `FUSIO_APPS_URL` variable. Depending on your setup this can be either a custom sub-domain like
`https://apps.acme.com` or simply the sub folder `https://acme.com/apps`.

## Backend

![Backend](https://www.fusio-project.org/media/backend/routes.png)

The backend app is the main app to configure and manage your API. The installer automatically installs this app. The app
is located at `/apps/fusio/`.

## VSCode

Fusio provides a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Fusio.fusio)
which can be used to simplify action development. This means you can develop every action directly inside
the VSCode editor.

# Services

* [Cloud](https://fusio.cloud/)  
  The cloud service allows you to create a Fusio instance in the cloud. It really simplifies the usage of Fusio since
  you can create and manage an instance through a simple web interface.
* [APIgen](https://apigen.app/)  
  APIgen is a code generator which allows you to generate code based on a data structure, which you can define
  at the backend. The tool generates based on this data structure a complete API tailored to your use case which
  you can use to CRUD those entities.

# Installation

It is possible to install Fusio either through composer or manually file download.

## Composer

```
composer create-project fusio/fusio
```

## Download

https://github.com/apioo/fusio/releases

## Configuration

You can either manually install Fusio with the steps below or you can also use the browser based installer at
`public/install.php`. Note because of security reasons it is highly recommended removing the installer script after the
installation.

* __Adjust the configuration file__  
  Open the file `.env` in the Fusio directory and change the `FUSIO_URL` to the domain pointing to the public folder.
  Also insert the database credentials to the `FUSIO_DB_*` keys. Optional adjust `FUSIO_APPS_URL` to the public url
  of the apps folder (in case you want to use apps).
* __Execute the installation command__  
  The installation script inserts the Fusio database schema into the provided database. It can be executed with the
  following command `php bin/fusio install`.
* __Create administrator user__  
  After the installation is complete you have to create a new administrator account. Therefor you can use the following
  command `php bin/fusio adduser`. Choose as account type "Administrator".
* __Install backend app__  
  To manage your API through an admin panel you need to install the backend app. The app can be installed with the
  following command `php bin/fusio marketplace:install fusio`

You can verify the installation by visiting the `FUSIO_URL` with a browser. You should see an API response that the
installation was successful.

In case you want to install Fusio on a specific database you need to adjust the `driver` parameter at the
`configuration.php` file:

* `pdo_mysql`: MySQL
* `pdo_sqlite`: SQLite
* `pdo_pgsql`: PostgreSQL
* `sqlsrv`: Microsoft SQL Server
* `oci8`: Oracle
* `sqlanywhere`: SAP Sybase SQL Anywhere

## Docker

Alternatively it is also possible to setup Fusio through docker. This has the advantage that you automatically get a
complete running Fusio system without configuration. This is especially great for testing and evaluation. To setup the
container you have to checkout the [repository](https://github.com/apioo/fusio-docker) and run the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This builds the Fusio system with a predefined backend account. The credentials are taken from the env variables
`FUSIO_BACKEND_USER`, `FUSIO_BACKEND_EMAIL` and `FUSIO_BACKEND_PW` in the `docker-compose.yml`. If you are planing to
run the container on the internet you must change these credentials.

# Contribution

Contributions to the project are always appreciated. There are many options available to improve the project (which is
not limited to coding). The following list shows some ways how you can participate:

## Developing

If you are a PHP or Javascript developer you can help to improve the system. If you want to create a new feature it is
in general recommended to create a new issue where we can talk about the feature before you start to hack on it. So
there are three main components of Fusio:

**[Backend-API](https://github.com/apioo/fusio-impl)**

The backend API is the core of the system developed in PHP, which provides the basic functionality of Fusio. This is the
place to develop new core features and improvements.

**[Adapter](https://www.fusio-project.org/adapter)**

An adapter is a plugin to the Fusio system which can be used to connect to other remote services. I.e. you could create
a new adapter which speaks to a specific API or other remote service. This is easy to develop since you can build it in
a separate repository. Please use the keyword `fusio-adapter` in your `composer.json` file so that adapter gets listed
automatically on our website.

**[Backend-App](https://github.com/apioo/fusio-backend)**

This is the Angular app which is used as GUI to control the backend. It is the main app to improve the Fusio backend.
But you are also free to develop new apps for special use cases which talk to the internal API of Fusio.

## Testing

We have a high PHPUnit test case coverage. Beside this it is always great if users checkout the current master version
of the project and try to test every aspect of the system. In case you have found an issue please report it through the
issue tracker.

## Documentation

We want to create a system which is easy to use also by novice users. To enable everybody to start using Fusio we need
a great documentation. We have bundled all documentation at our [documentation website](https://docs.fusio-project.org/)
please feel free to adjust or contribute new documents in case you think something is missing or wrong.
